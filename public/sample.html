New users don't know it exists.\n\n2. Individual vs. team workflows: The product assumes solo work, but most customers work in teams. Adding collaboration would unlock viral growth.\n\n3. Flexibility vs. guidance: You offer tons of customization, but most users just want good defaults and templates to start from.",
      fit: "I've spent the last 5 years building analytics products for technical and non-technical users. I'm especially strong at simplifying complex tools without dumbing them down—making power accessible. I love the problem space you're in and would be excited to help Dashboard Pro reach its next stage of growth."
